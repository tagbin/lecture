Now let's do some study.......

#Settings

# to create an ssh key
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa
2. paste ur ssh key to git-settings.
that's it..

1. git add <directory name> 	# use . for whole directory
2. git commit -m "Comments"
3. git push origin master 	#to push commits to git repo
4. git status 			#to check to present status of repo

# New Branch
> git branch <new-branch-name>

# Shift to new branch
> git checkout <new-branch-name>

# If you've added some changes, stage them
> git add <path>          # The path could be file or a directory

# Commit these changes 
> git commit -m "Commit Message Here"  				# -m stands for commit message

# Push your changes
> git push <remote> <branch>

# Done!



# Before pushing always pull the master branch
git pull origin master


Note: origin denotes a git remote where files are uploaded to....
Issue the command
> git remote -v
to view git remotes in your current repository
origin is default...

e.g when pushing changes to heroku... heroku adds another remote
in that case... pushing to heroku becomes
> git push heroku master
